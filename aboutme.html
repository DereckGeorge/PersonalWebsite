              <p><strong>Education Background</strong></p>
              <p>I started my primary education at olympio primary
                school. Then I went to Loyola high for my secondary education and finally went to Tambaza high to finish my advanceed level education.
                I am currently pursuing my bachelor degree at the University of Dar es Salaam.
              </p>
        
              <p><strong>University Life</strong></p>
              <p>I am enrolled in the Business Information Technology degree program, which offers a unique understanding of business management and technology courses.
                 This program equips students with a solid foundation in both fields, allowing them to bridge the gap between business operations and technology 
                 solutions. By studying Business Information Technology, I believe i wil gain a comprehensive understanding of how technology can be strategically 
                 applied to enhance organizational efficiency, innovation, and competitiveness. 
        
                Among the various courses I have taken, my favorite is C programming. This course sharpened my problem-solving skills but has also provided
                a good grounding in programming fundamentals. Learning C programming has been an exciting journey. I appreciate the logic required in writing efficient programs.
                
                In my discussion group, I have the pleasure of working with my friends Ashraf, Kelvin, and Jackie. We form a good team, each bringing unique
                perspectives and strengths to our group discussions and projects. Our collaborative efforts have helped us in enhancing our understanding of course 
                materials and creative solutions. Together, we tackle challenges, exchange ideas, and support one another.
        
              <p><strong>Career Goals</strong></p>
              <p>Mobile application development is so far what i see myself at in the coming days. I will be a self employed app developer. My programming
                road at first did not have any specific goal, I just wanted to learn how to programm a computer. But now i want to specify in the mobile 
                application development niche.
              </p>
        
              <p><strong>Degree Sponsorship</strong></p>
              <p>I am currently pursuing my university degree through the financial support of my parents. While I am not sponsored by any external organizations
                 or scholarships, I am fortunate enough to have parents who have taken on the responsibility of funding my education. They understand the value of
                 higher education and have made it a priority to invest in my future. Their unwavering support has enabled me to focus on my studies and fully immerse 
                 myself in the university experience. I am truly grateful for their sacrifice and commitment in providing me with this opportunity to pursue my academic goals.
